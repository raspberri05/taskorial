        subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.
        This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned

        in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with
        the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in
        connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered
        trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service

        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that
        the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their
        agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such
        remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
        effect.
