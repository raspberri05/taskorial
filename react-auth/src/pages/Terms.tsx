        subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.
        This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned

        in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with

        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that
        the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their
